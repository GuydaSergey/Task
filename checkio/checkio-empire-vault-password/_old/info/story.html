    <p>"It’s incredible how exhausted I feel already." Sofia told Stephen. "I’ve scratched myself a million times on the
        old, rusty corners of this ship." she spoke louder as she walked closer to Stephen. She even limped a little
        with the hope that Stephen would notice and ask her to stop cleaning.</p>

    <p>"Yes, there is a lot of work to do," Stephen said while carefully reading the list from Nikola. He wasn’t paying
        Sofia much attention. "But that’s fine, we’ll get everything finished today. Oh, and by the way, I saw a huge
        pile of stuff that needs to be sorted by the captains cabin. Some of this junk should be in a museum..."</p>

    <p>"When did you get so smart?" Sofia mumbled as she sorted out the details.</p>

    <p>"There you are Sofia! I was looking for you on the bridge." said a new voice.</p>

    <p>"Hello Nikola. As you can see, there is quite a lot of work to do here." Sofia said glaring at Stephen, hoping
        for any degree of support or help from him. <a class="more"><b>More...</b></a></p>

    <div class="end">
        <p>"I can see that..." said Nikola. "I just need a moment of your attention. Since we're leaving for a while, we
            need to program all the locks in the house, workshop, garage and warehouse."</p>

        <p>"I don’t think it’s necessary, but if you do, go ahead and take care of it yourself."</p>

        <p>"No, I can't. You're the owner of the house so you have to lock all the doors and come up with a password for
            each of them."</p>

        <p>"12345," Sofia said wearily. "Now you've got a number for each building. Happy?"</p>

        <p>"No! No, no, no! That's not good enough! You have make a stronger password--"</p>

        <p>"67890," Sofia interrupted him. She looked at his face and saw his disappointment. "Nikola, what do you
            expect from me? It’s been a long day and I am extremely tired. I cannot think about anything but
            sleeping."</p>

        <p>"Ok, in 10 minutes I’ll come by with a password verificator that will check whether it’s strong or not. As
            soon as it approves all the passwords I will program them for all the locks."</p>

        <p>"Alright, so tell me, what is with the paranoia? And what are the requirements for a password?"</p>

        <p>"I'm not paranoid! They're just standard security measures that everyone should use. The passwords length
            should be no less than 10 characters and must contain at least one number, one uppercase letter, and one
            lowercase letter."</p>

        <p>"Fine, bring in your password gizmo then!"</p>
