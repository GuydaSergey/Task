In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, a skew-symmetric matrix(also known as an antisymmetric or antimetric) 
is a square matrix <strong>A</strong> whose transpose is also its negative.
This means it satisfies the equation A=-A<sup>T</sup>.
If the entry in the i-th row and j-th column is a<sub>ij</sub>, i.e.
A=(a<sub>ij</sub>) then the symmetric condition becomes a<sub>ij</sub>=-a<sub>ji</sub>.

You should determine whether the specified square matrix is skew-symmetric or not.

You can find more details on Skew-symmetric matrices on its [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix).
