        In a great number of the cosmogonic myths the world is said to have developed from a great water, which was the
        prime matter. In many cases, as for instance in an Indian myth, this prime matter is indicated as a solution,
        out of which the solid earth crystallized out.

    With linear and slice scans complete, we are now ready to check the crystals with a 3D scanner. For this, we'll
    start with a cubic sample of the crystal and check the adjacent atoms, much like in the previous scans. This crystal
    type contains two atoms composing the elements "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium). In a well grown crystal, these atoms
    should alternate down each of the three axis.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a sample crystal as a 3D array of atoms. Well formed crystals will have atoms alternating along the X,
    Y and Z axis (height, width, depth). If any atoms are found next to the same type of atom, then this crystal is
    unusable.

    This mission can show you work with more deep structures, which can not be easily drawn in notebook.
