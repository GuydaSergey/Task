With the linear and slice scans completed, we are now ready to check the crystals with a 3D scanner. For this, we'll
start with a cubic sample of the crystal and check the adjacent atoms, much like in the previous scans. This crystal
type contains two atoms composed of the elements "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium). In a well grown crystal, these atoms
should alternate down each of the three axis.

You are given a sample crystal as a 3D array of atoms. Well formed crystals will have atoms alternating along the X,
Y and Z axis (height, width, depth). If any atoms are found next to the same type of atom, then this crystal is
unusable.
