All of the rings are numbered and you know which of the rings are connected.
This information is given as a sequence of pairs.
Each pair describes the connected rings. For example: {1, 2} means that the 1st and 2nd rings are connected.
You should count how many rings we need to break to get the maximum of separate rings. 
Each of the rings are numbered in a range from 1 to N, where N is total quantity of rings.

For example: `{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{4,5},{4,6},{6,5}`.
The optimal solution here would be to break 3 rings, making 3 full and separate rings. So the result is 3.
