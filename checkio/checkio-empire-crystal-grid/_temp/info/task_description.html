        An equal number of atoms, combined in the same way produce the same crystal forms, and the same crystal form
        does not depend on the nature of the atoms, but only on their number and mode of combination.

    The initial crystal quality check phase (link) is not enough to satisfactorily pass a crystal for use. As such, we
    need to work to improve the process. Since we've checked random atomic lines/rows, perhaps it would be best to
    perform check random checks on slices of the crystal. This crystal type contains two atoms composing the elements
    "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium). In a well grown crystal, these atoms should alternate down each row and column.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a slice of crystal lattice as a grid (2D array) of atoms "X" and "Z". The well grown grid should have
    proper periodic arrangements both horizontally and vertically. If one atom is found next to another atom of its
    element, the crystal is unusable. For example:
</p>

<pre>
[["X", "Z"],
 ["Z", "X"]] is good

[["X", "Z", "X"],
 ["Z", "X", "Z"],
 ["X", "Z", "X"]] is good

[["X", "Z", "X"],
 ["Z", "Z", "Z"],
 ["X", "Z", "X"]] is bad
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    In this mission we will use more complex structure as list of list. This structure often use as tables or grids or
    land maps.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    1 &lt; len(grid) &le; 10<br>
    1 &lt; len(grid[0]) &le; 10<br>
    all(len(row) == len(grid[0]) for row in grid)<br>
    all(all(ch in "XZ" for ch in line) for line in grid)<br>
