    <p>"Nikola, A1213pokl, bAse730onE."</p>

    <p>"Yes Sofia, what is it?"</p>

    <p>"You tell me! Your torture device is singing my circuits with its new lexicon. There is no way I can remember
        these new passwords and the thing doesn't accept simple and easy ones!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, those will be good passwords, you can use them."</p>

    <p>"Why can’t you use them!?" Sofia asked almost hysterically. "I’ve already forgotten them! Do you want me locked
        out of my own house for eternity? Come up with something easier so I don’t have to keep all that randomized
        gobbledygook in my head." Sofia rarely acted so demanding but she had reached her boiling point. The stress of
        the past few days coupled with her exhaustion had brought her to the edge.</p>

    <p>"Don’t worry, <a class="more"><b>More...</b></a></p>

    <div class="end">
        <p>...I was expecting something easier to remember. Why don’t you use the cipher map to help with your password.
            With it we can encrypt all the passwords and leave them right next to the door or in a special place that we
            all agree upon. You will only be able to read them with the use of the cipher map which we will take with us
            on our trip.</p>

        <p>"So I don’t need to remember all of those passwords? All we have to do is make sure that we don't lose the
            cipher map." asked Sofia with hopefully.</p>

        <p>"Yes, that is correct."</p>

        <p>"Awesome. Show me the cipher map and explain how this works one more time."</p>
