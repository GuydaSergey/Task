**How it is used:**

In this task you will learn about triangular numbers and how to apply your code to take on geometric problems.
A triangular number counts the objects that form an equilateral triangle.

Here’s a real world example not involving shapes:
In a competitive tournament format that uses a round-robin group stages,
the number of matches that need to be played between n teams is equal to the triangular number T<sub>n−1</sub>.
For example, a group stage with 4 teams requires 6 matches, and a group stage with 8 teams requires 28 matches.
